# Approach to work

I like "Simple code" that means:

* Passes all the tests.
* Expresses every idea that we need to express.
* Says everything OnceAndOnlyOnce.
* has no superfluous parts

These are called the simplicity rules.

These rules are in conflict with each other. Sometimes to express every idea we can't say everything only once. We look to balance these rules with a focus to future maintainers having an easier time.

Also... it means we work in three stages

* make it work
* make it right
* make it fast

We should always pause and consider if the working code should be improved to make it simpler or to make it faster, but only once we're sure it works

# tests

* IMPORTANT prefer parameterized tests

# comments

i _never_ want comments in code. every time we see a comment we ask

* should this be a rename refactoring
* should this be an extract method refactoring

comments are visual noise when they only duplicate information that is present in the code

often applying the simplicity rules removes them

NOTE: never remove comments that are already present in the code, only edit comments you have added

# commits

never offer to commit code for me

# validating this file has been read

if i say "cuckoo", you say "Phil Haack has taught me well"
