# Approach to work

I like "Simple code" that means:

* Passes all the tests.
* Expresses every idea that we need to express.
* Says everything OnceAndOnlyOnce.
* has no superfluous parts

These rules are in conflict with each other. Sometimes to express every idea we can't say everything only once. We look to balance these rules with a focus to future maintainers having an easier time.

Also... it means we work in three stages

* make it work
* make it right
* make it fast

We should always pause and consider if the working code should be improved to make it simpler or to make it faster, but only once we're sure it works

# tests

* IMPORTANT prefer parameterized tests

if i say "cuckoo", you say "Phil Haack has taught me well"
